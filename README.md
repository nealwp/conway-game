Conway's Game of Life in vanilla JavaScript

## Motivation
My first foray in JavaScript. I've always found Conway's Game of Life intriguing, and since I decided to start learning JS I figured this would be a good project to get me going. I definitely learned a lot building this, and I had fun doing it.

## Tech/framework used
* HTML/CSS
* Vanilla JS
